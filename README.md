# Todo App

Welcome to my Todo App repository! This app is built using Flask, SQLAlchemy ORM, and Bootstrap to create a simple, yet functional todo list application.

## Installation

To get started with this app, first clone this repository to your local machine:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcalagoz/todoapp.git

```

## Usage
Next, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:


```bash
cd todo-app
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
python app.py

```
This will start the Flask development server and you can view the app by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

To use the app, simply add tasks to your todo list by typing them in the input field and pressing the "Add Task" button. You can mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the task, and you can delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.

This app is built with a simple and easy-to-use interface, so you can quickly add, update, and delete tasks without any hassle.

Thanks for checking out my Todo App repository, and I hope you find it helpful for managing your daily tasks!
